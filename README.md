## How to run the project

First, since this is a React project, you need to have both NodeJS and NPM installed, having those will enable you to run the project and install its dependencies.
Once you have everything set up, you need to:

Clone the repo to any folder you want with `git clone <repo link>`.
Get into the directory with `cd react-autocomplete`.
Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
Run the project with `npm start`.

With that set of commands, the project will be running under (development mode) [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll be able to access it in your browser.

## About the project

This is a basic AutoComplete component, it aims to help users complete their input within a pre-defined set of strings (like a search bar).
It took around 1.5 hours to complete.
Many things could be more elaborated, like dinamically getting a set of strings from another resource or setting some hyper-parameters, but those things would take time and I thought it was better to keep it simple.
